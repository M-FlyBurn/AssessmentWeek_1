// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//1. Planning
//2. Analysis of Requirements
//3. Design
//4. Implementation
//5.Testing & Intergration
//6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step of the SDLC, at this step software engineers must analyze and anticipate what is required and the most fitting ways to create the desired outcome."

const design = "The third step of SDLC is to design the architecture of the product, commonly achievd by working on a team of stakeholders who review and determine the best design approach for the project/product."

const implementation= "The fourth step of SDLC is to implement, this means that software engineers work to build the intended product by coding it in the chosen coding language."

const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step of SDLC is to test the product, to ensure that it performs desired outcomes. At this stage any problems with the software is recorded and repaired/improved. Retesting is required until the software can perform at desired quality."

const maintain = "In the final stage, the product is released to intended audience, at this stage the software must be maintained to ensure it caters to intended purpose/audience."
